# Iris_Classification 
Iris Classification aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. It utilizes the popular Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
The dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample having four feature values and a corresponding target label.
Several classification models are implemented in this project to classify the Iris flowers:

Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
Support Vector Machines (SVM) Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
The models are trained using the Iris dataset and evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
